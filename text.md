SUBJECT: 
Exciting Post-Doctoral Opportunity in Computer Science in Pisa

Dear all,
 
a call for postdocs has been recently opened at ISTI-CNR; it's in Italian but can be translated with the usual tools. 

One of the position is for working together with the FMTLAB (Formal Methods and Tools Laboratory) in Pisa, under the supervision of dr. Vincenzo Ciancia, on topics related to spatial logics, formal methods, artificial intelligence or human-computer interaction, in a recently financed national PRIN project directed by Prof. F. Gadducci.

The ideal candidate is interested in working on the link between spatial logics, model checking, and artificial intelligence oriented to medical imaging, be it either voxel-based imaging or  3d mesh-based. The topic is centered around "human centric" methods, therefore also candidates from the area of HCI/ UX design / formal methods in UX/UI are very welcome. A strong plus is the ability to work on implementation matters (e.g. of the core model checker, or the user interface, or the planned machine learning modules, or imaging experiments). So is also affinity with the field of Formal Methods in Computer Science.

The city of Pisa offers a very exciting environment for Computer Science research due to a high concentration of top research institutions (CNR, University of Pisa, Santâ€™Anna School of Advanced Studies, IMT School for Advanced Studies Lucca, University of Florence). The FMT group has strong ties with all these institutions, and a wide international collaboration network.
 
IN SHORT:
 
- POSTDOC POSITION: PhD required
- Deadline for application: Jan 22, 2024 (if interested but can't match the deadline because of the Ph.D. requirement, please get in touch, there may be other calls in the near future)
- Expertise required: spatial logics, or model checking, or machine learning, or human-computer interaction, or medical imaging
- Implementation skills are a plus
- Confidence in Formal Methods is a plus
- Place of work: ISTI-CNR in Pisa
- Duration: 1 year, renewable
- Salary: 22k Euros gross; due to a special fiscal treatment of this kind of contract, the net salary should be about 1600-1700 euros per month, which is above average considering the costs of living in Pisa.

Potential candidates, especially if from abroad, are advised to get in touch promptly, in order to get a clearer idea of the admission requirements and the correspondence between Master of Science degrees obtained in countries different from Italy.
